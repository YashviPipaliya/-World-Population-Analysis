Exploratory data analysis of world population data
I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis on the world population data from UN and World Bank. The main goal of this EDA is to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data that can provide insights into population dynamics and trends.

## Conclusion
From the analysis of population data, it's evident that Asia is the most populous continent, with the largest percentage of the world's population. In contrast, Africa, which holds the second-highest population percentage, has the lowest population density. This illustrates the significance of taking into account both population size and population density when studying population data.
